// <etymology>
// This class is simulator that uses a simple observational model that is 
// typical of modern "guest observer" interferometers. 
// </etymology>
//
// <synopsis> 
// Despite the "Simple" in its name, this class is capable of driving 
// simulated interometric observations using a variety of typical observing 
// patterns.  At its simplest, it can integrate on a single source for a 
// set amount of time; at its most complex it can observe a pattern of fields,
// switch between sources (e.g. target and calibrator), switch between 
// polarization set ups, and fill multiple spectral windows.  It does assume
// that it will write all its data to a single MeasurementSet that it creates.
// <p>
//
// This class uses a general pattern intended for a whole class of simulators
// of which this simulator is one.  In this pattern, the application first 
// defines the telescope's hardware--i.e. the antennas, the feeds and 
// polarizations, and the spectral windows,  via a SimTelescope object.  
// Next, the SimTelescope is passed to a SimObservation object, and the 
// observational configurations are added; this includes the sources, fields,
// spectral lines, and window-polarization combinations (i.e. data 
// descriptions).  The SimObservation object is then passed to the constructor
// of a simulator.  One can then define some global properties of the 
// observations, include blockage and elevation limits.  <p>
//
// The simulations are carried out by a series of calls to the write() function.
// This causes the definition of the telescope and the observational parameters
// to be written to the output MS along with integration records in the MS's 
// main table for each baseline, data description, and timestamp over some 
// interval of time.  Note that the MS's DATA column will be filled with zeros;
// it is intended that visibilities based on a source model will be filled 
// into this column later using the Measurment Equation.  <p>
//
// Each call to the write() function represents a new scan.  The parameters 
// that define the scan are a start time, a duration, and the various 
// properties held in a <linkto class="SimScan">SimScan</linkto> object.  In 
// non-trivial simulation, an application may manage several SimScan objects,
// each containing the configuration choices for the different phases of the 
// observations.  For example, if the observational program observes multiple
// sources, the application would have one SimScan for each source.  <p>
//
// The writeObsRecord() function is meant to be called after a series of 
// calls to write(), marking a major transition point in the observations 
// (e.g. switch to a new day or track).  It should be called at least once at 
// the end of the observations.  This will write out a record to the 
// OBSERVATION subtable and increment the OBSERVATION_ID that is written to
// the main table.  <p>
//
// Data is flushed after every call to write() and writeObsRecord(); thus,
// it is possible for other classes to open the output measurement set for 
// read-only access.  Destructing the class closes out the measurment set 
// permanently.  <p>
// 
// It is possible after calls to write() to add to the telescopes 
// configuration--e.g. add antennas, windows, sources, etc.  When write() 
// is called again, the new configuration will get flushed to the MS 
// automatically. <p>
// </synopsis> 
//
// <motivation>
// This replaces the functionality of the MSSimulator class and is based on the 
// more flexible SimTelescope & SimObservations classes.  Together, these 
// classes are capable of simulated the most typical types of observations
// carried out by interferometers like the VLA, BIMA, ATCA, ....
// </motivation>
