// This is a container for describing doppler tracking in simulated 
// observations.  
// </etymology>
//
// <synopsis> 
// This container holds data describing a spectral line to be observed,
// along with which spectral windows it can appear in.  This information
// is ultimately destined to be recorded in a Measurement Set:  the spectral
// line--that is, the species name, transition, and rest frequency--will go
// in the SOURCE table; however, the association with spectral windows is 
// recorded in the DOPPLER table.  
// This container is used to define simulated observations.  Simulators would
// not normally create these objects directly but rather implicitly via the
// <linkto class="SimObservations">SimObservations</linkto> class.  <p>
//
// The spectral line information is set at construction time and cannot be
// updated later.  The only writable data is a row marker (set with setRow())
// which is used by <linkto class="SimDopplerList">SimDopplerList</linkto>
// to flag whether the line has been recorded to an MS, yet.  The marker value 
// represents the first row in the DOPPLER table corresponding to the 
// SimDoppler's spectral line.  Since a line can be associated with multiple
// spectral windows, a single SimDoppler can result in several DOPPLER records
// (as well as SOURCE records).  <p>
//
// Note that when a SimDoppler is created, no check is done to ensure that
// the source ID and spectral window IDs exist or are otherwise valid; in 
// general, this should be done at a higher level.  On the other hand, the 
// <linkto class="SimDopplerList">SimDopplerList</linkto> does check validity 
// when it writes the line data to an MS.  It skips over any SimDopplers 
// with invalid IDs, and it refuses associate a line with a window that has
// already been linked to a different line.  Thus if a spectral line window
// is referenced multiple times, either within a single SimDoppler or across
// several, the first one encountered takes precendence.  
// </synopsis> 
//
// <motivation>
// This container provides an simplified in-memory representation of 
// feeds that will ultimately be written to a DOPPLER table.  It is mainly
// needed as a way to associate spectral window with a particular a spectral 
// line.  The interface is oriented toward what is typical with current 
// instruments and thus is simpler than the interface provided by the MS 
// DOPPLER table.
// </motivation>
//
// <todo asof="03/03/25">
//   <li> It would probably be helpful to have a common base classes for 
//        all Sim* and Sim*List classes that are managed by SimTelescope
//        and SimObservations
//   <li> Strictly speaking, the DOPPLER table is meant to exist only 
//        when doppler tracking is used.  However, when this class was 
//        first created, it provided the only mechanism for associating
//        spectral line (recorded in the SOURCE table) with a spectral 
//        window.  This may no longer be necessary; thus, it might be 
//        useful to transform this class into a SimSpLine class.

// <linkto class="SimObservations">SimObservations</linkto> class.  <p>
//
// An important function handled by this class is the recording of the 
// spectral lines to a Measurement Set.  This is done with the flush()
// function which writes to the SOURCE, SPECTRAL_WINDOW, and DOPPLER tables.  
// When a SimDoppler is written out, it sets the row number of the first 
// DOPPLER record corresponding to it via the setRow() function;
// this is used as a flag indicating that the SimDoppler has been flushed.  This
// allows one to later add additional setups to the list; when flush() is 
// called again, only the new SimDoppler data are written out.  This, of 
// course, assumes that the same set of output MS tables are passed to the 
// flush() function each time.  If you want to write all the data to a new 
// DOPPLER table, you can call clearIds() to clear all the row 
// markers.  <p>
// 
// A list of polarization setups can be read in from a DOPPLER table 
// as well using the initFrom() method or the 
// SimDopplerList(const MSDoppler&, const MSSource&, const MSpectralWindow&) 
// constructor.  These will implicitly set the row markers from the input 
// table.  This allows one to add new setups to the already recorded set.
//
// Note that when a SimDoppler is added to the list, no check is done to 
// ensure that the source ID and spectral window IDs exist or are otherwise 
// valid (in general, this should be done at a higher level).  Validity is
// checked, however, when the list is written out to an MS.  It skips over 
// any SimDopplers with invalid IDs, and it refuses associate a line with 
// a window that has already been linked to a different line.  Thus if a
